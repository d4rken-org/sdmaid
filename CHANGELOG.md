In Detail: Icons for owners flagged as `CUSTODIAN` (e.g. "Android" for all default dirs on AOSP such as `Download/`) will only be shown when there is no other "normal" owner for that item (#2816).

### AppCleaner
- Improved: ACS based deletion on MIUI ROMs, additional locales (#2816).
- Improved: Added tracking for ACS failures due to missing locale support to find out if there are languages that need support but no one has spoken up yet.

- Improved: Empty directories filter, support for nested empty directories. SD Maid will do recursive passes on directories that are readable through the JAVA File api (that don't require root or the SAF). If the directory contains ONLY other directories, and all directories are readable (no surpises) and no exclusions are matched, then the whole nested directory tree will be considered empty (#201).

### AppCleaner
- Added: ACS based deletion support for MIUI ROMs (tested on v10.x). Currently only supports `en_*` locales, if you want support for your locale, make a ticket ;). Huge shoutout to Jeff who helped me debug this (#2783).

### CorpseFinder
- Fixed: Root only settings being clickable after resetting the CorpseFinder settings (#2697).

### SystemCleaner
- Improved: .log file should no longer show duplicate results due to overlap between private and public storage (#961).
- Improved: Added restrictions to exclude certain .log files that could cause issues when deleted (e.g. indexdb).

### Duplicates
- Improved: To prevent issues with performance and checksuming very small files, there is now an enforced minimum size of 1024B (#2737).
- Fixed: Internal selection not being cleared when the multiselection action mode is finished (#2512).

- Improved: Debugging output, more infos about device and app locales.
- Fixed: Potential crash during primary storage setup on Android 6.X.

### AppCleaner
- Improved: ACS based deletion on vietnamese ROMs.
- Changed: I've removed an internal minimum cache size for unrooted devices. While there is a public minimum cache size setting, there was also an internal minimum that was only in effect when the AppCleaner ran without root. The limit ranged from 12KB to 48KB, depending on your Android version. It's purpose was to exclude apps whose cache only consists of empty default folders (e.g. `files` or `cache`) that are (re)created by the system. Without a limit you'd always have results with apps having a few KBs of cache. I don't recommend setting the limit to 0KB, nonetheless if you want to, it now works as expected without root.
- Changed: To account for above mentioned changes I've raised the default minimum cache size in the settings to 48KB.

- Fixed: Potential crash if SD Maid is put into the background for longer durations during the setup steps.

### CorpseFinder
- Improved: Matching of ownership on default folders (e.g. `Android/data`). Uninstall watcher should now suggest default folders for deletion if left behind on uninstall (#2672).
- Fixed: UninstallWatcher on Android Q. Android Q blocks popups from background. I replaced the popup with an interactive notification (#2672).

### AppCleaner
- Improved: ACS based cache deletion on french ROMs.
- Fixed: Matching did not work when SD Maid's option to enforce language is used and differs from the system language (#2407).

## SD Maid [v4.14.20](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/91?closed=1) 07.06.2019

### Core
- Improved: Updated clutter db.
- Improved: Updated translations.

### Core
- Fixed: Potential two potential crashes when opening SD Maid, both related to the upgrade routine that was changed in v4.14.15. A stereotypical racecondition: 3 threads battle each other and depending on which one has the CPU's favor we get into an undesired state. Should have seen that, but didn't :'(, hindsight... etc.

### Core
- Improved: Clutter database.
- Improved: Switched to new code shrinker (R8), smaller APK, possibly better performance.
- Improved: Internal build improvements.
- Changed: The setup step for usage stats permission can now be skipped as it's only required for a select few features at the moment. Obviously features that depend on it will not work then.

## SD Maid [v4.14.1](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/72?closed=1) 16.04.2019
### Core
- Added: A debug task to the debug menu that logs the UI tree such that users can record a debug log, run that task, do what SD Maid should do, and then provide me with the log such that I can add support for accessibility service based cache deletion on their ROM+locale.
- Improved: Debug logging (removed some logging, added some logging).
- Improved: Updated clutter database.
- Improved: Updated translations.
- Improved: Internal settings logic will now make it obvious (via crash) if in some cases setting changes are only reflected in the UI but not persisted.

- Possibly: Fixed a crash when opening SD Maid due to an UI inflation error on < 4.3 ROMs that basically shouldn't be possible, but crash tracking says otherwise.
- Changed: I've updated the domain SD Maid's analytics server to `matomo.darken.eu` (was `piwik.darken.eu`), same server just a different domain.

### Explorer
- Improved: Small improvements to result messages (chmod, delete, extract).
- Improved: Settings related code, deduplicating routines such that there is a single source of truth for settings.
- Fixed: Crash when opening via shortcut.
- Fixed: Crash when a task produced no successful results but we tried to scroll them into view anyway...
- Fixed: Three cases where refreshing the current path under certain circumstances could lead to a crash.

### AppControl
- Improved: Some ROMs don't allow you to launch arbitrary activities outside an apps main activity, if that's the case we now show an error instead of crashing.
- Fixed: A crash when determining an apps size and the system gives us some information that is unexpected null.

### SystemCleaner
- Fixed: Crash when creating editing filters on Meizu devices (ROM bug related to text input).

### AppCleaner
- Added: Accessibility service based cache deletion for locales `zh` and `ja` on AOSP and similar ROMs.
- Added: When accessibility based deletion is enabled but the service is not running the details view will now also offer a shortcut to restart the service.
- Improved: Most filters will now exclude the `.nomedia` file from deletion.
- Improved: After cache deletion via accessibility service was performed, just resume SD Maid, don't explicitly open the AppCleaners page as you could have started out on the quick access page (#2486).
- Improved: Small improvements to confirmation dialogs.
- Improved: If something is not supported by your ROM it will show an error instead of crash now (e.g. no accessibility services on Android TV).
- Improved: The accessibility cache deletion task looks whether the desired screen is open, then traverses the view tree and filters for the desired target node. The initial routine that waits for the right screen will now timeout quicker and on retry attempt to launch desired screen again (previously we just assumed the first intent launched the screen correctly).
- Improved: Accessibility service related debug logging, instead of breadth-first, we do depth-first and log the actual UI structure.
- Fixed: Failing to find the clear cache button on some ROMs due to internal UI differences (#2473).
- Fixed: A couple of error states that should abort accessibility service based cache cleaning but instead took down the whole app.
- Fixed: Crash during scanning on unrooted devices if the device has expanded it's internal storage via sdcard and SD Maid was moved to that storage. The path splitting/matching made some assumptions about length that didn't hold true. I actually had tagged it with a TODO, as I thought this case doesn't really occur, well it does ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
- Fixed: The "include system apps" setting should no longer be ignored.
- Fixed: Crash when deleting whole a whole apps cache via it's details screen. Due to a racecondition, the UI tried to refresh the page for an app that was no longer part of the dataset.
- Fixed: When deleting an apps inaccessible cache via the details view it should now no longer be removed from the data set if that deletion failed.

### Scheduler
- Improved: Scheduler settings code, added reset option.
- Fixed: Crash when entering settings due to racecondition between multiple initializations (#2466)

## SD Maid [v4.14.0](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/69?closed=1) 05.04.2019
### Core
- Added: Donation options via GPlay IAP.
- Added: Request for usage stats permission to the setup flow.
- Added: Advanced settings option to manually trigger the setup flow again without requiring a reset.
- Added: Minimum unlocker version requirement. SD Maids setup will enforce a minimum unlocker version of v4.3.6.
- Improved: Complete rework of setup flow, nicer UI, better architecture (to prepare for Android Q changes).
- Improved: Internal migration to AndroidX libraries.
- Improved: Debug recorder.
- Improved: Debugging, added information about current locale and `armed` state.
- Improved: Clutter database.
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Small improvements to the account API.
- Improved: New update check logic and UI flow, server side changes to simplify infrastructure.
- Improved: The debug option `armed` now affects the schedulers reboot options too.
- Changed: "Free version" is now named "Basic version".
- Fixed: Potential crash when debugging due to a racecondition when trying to print information about active shell threads.
- Fixed: A case where an error during the base setup could crash the whole app.
- Fixed: Setup canceling should now reliably allow you to restart the setup again.
- Fixed: Network requests to Bugsnag.com happening despite user opt-out (#2400).
- Fixed: Potential crash that could occur when quickly pausing resuming screens that contains previews.
- Fixed: Fixed issues related to selecting items in a tool's details view and then pausing+resuming the screen.
- Fixed: Debug log recordings not being resumed after restarting the device and or SD Maid, despite never being stopped.

### Explorer
- Added: Ability to calculate and compare MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 checksum for files (#1517).
- Added: Direct sorting within the UI instead of settings.
- Added: Sort options: Last changed, Size.
- Added: Option to reverse sort (#994).
- Added: Copy/Move tasks also add the paths to the clipboard (#1381).
- Improved: Save directory structure on multiple items are now saved into the same file.
- Improved: Navigation on Android 8.0 without root, automatically guide the user past `/storage/emulated`.
- Improved: Result displaying.
- Improved: Complete UI code rework.
- Improved: Complete settings code rework.
- Fixed: Don't allow renaming without changing the name.
- Fixed: Save directory structure on files should now work too.

### AppControl
- Improved: Menu labeling
- Fixed: Crash when uninstalling without root is not possible due to some weird ROM restrictions (`Not allowed to start intent UNINSTALL_PACKAGE`).

### SystemCleaner
- Fixed: Case where SystemCleaner custom filters could be created without the pro upgrade.

### AppCleaner
- Added: Accessibility service based cache cleaning for locales `en`,`de`,`cs`,`ru`,`es` (#2396). 
- Added: Cache cleaning via accessbility service (#1588).
- Improved: Complete core code rework.
- Improved: Support for determining inaccessible cache sizes on Android 8.0+.
- Improved: Depending the Android version an app may have several empty directories inside the default cache directory (1-4x4096Byte). Although the system may show a cache size of "12KB" it won't actually delete this on `Clear Cache`. SD Maid should not show these entries either as deletion attempts will seem to work but the files just resurface on the next scan.
- Fixed: Inaccurate deletion results in some cases when aborting a deletion task.

### Duplicates
- Added: Minimum file size option (16 KB by default). Files smaller than this will be excluded. The most common use case is finding larger 500KB+ duplicates of photos. This should reduce cases where the tool pics up duplicate icons or other app assets.

### Scheduler
- Fixed: The UI hanging (ANR) when reopening SD Maid (cold start) on the scheduler page and setup is required.

### Statistics
- Changed: Increased the default history limit to 21 days.

## SD Maid [v4.13.4](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/71?closed=1) 14.03.2019

- Improved: Activity shortcut creation code.
- Fixed: Activity shortcut actions showing empty result messages.
- Fixed: Activity shortcuts not being visible on white backgrounds due to the icon being white, it now has a grey background (#2299).

## SD Maid [v4.13.1](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/67?closed=1) 20.01.2019
### Core
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Clutter database.
- Improved: Debugging/logging.
- Improved: Added more instructions to help users restore SD Maid Pro.
- Added: Alternative way of upgrading to SD Maid Pro without Google and without extra app via [apps.darken.eu](https://apps.darken.eu). Currently in beta testing, requires at least SD Maid v4.13.1.

### AppControl
- Fixed: Potential fix for inconsistent sorting of chinese characters.

### AppCleaner
- Fixed: Potential fix for inconsistent sorting of chinese characters.

## SD Maid [v4.13.0](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/66?closed=1) 19.12.2018
### Core
- Improved: Clutter database (ty!).
- Improved: Translations (ty!).
- Improved: Improved debug logging.
- Added: Code for future support of purchases outside of Google Play and without unlocker app.
- Improved: Clutter data generation from SD Maids database. Better handling of apps with multiple definitions.
- Fixed: Possible crash due to theming when opening SD Maid.
- Improved: Few internal changes to object instantiation to improve overall architecture and lower memory consumption.
- Fixed: Possible crash that could occur when viewing tool details while deleting files.
- Improved: UX flow when clicking "Upgrade", added information about how to restore a purchase as this seems to be most common topic in emails I get.
- Improved: Automatic app detection for apps using their packagename for multiple directory names (e.g. com/app/pkg).
- Improved: Public storage on Android is case-insensitive. Clutter matching on public storage now fully understands that leading to more accurate detection with less overhead for multiple definitions.
- Improved: Overall improvements to filtering of paths with non-english locales/characters.

### Overview
- Added: Version display to binaries.
- Improved: SD Maid Pro display to account for alternate methods of unlocking.

### AppControl
- Fixed: Symlinks will no longer be followed when calculating app estates. This fixes size estimation for apps like Termux that symlink to public storage (#2166).
- Fixed: The receiver manager should no longer cut off the names (#2197).

### CorpseFinder
- Fixed: Uninstall watcher not deactivating when using "Reset to defaults" (#2196).

### AppCleaner
- Improved: The search algorithm can now search deeper. It will now find expendable files in directories that are nested several folders deep. Previously, to keep scan performance acceptable, SD Maid only compared against the top-level folders and if no top-level folder matched our filters we would skip them. I've now reversed this slightly such that we try to search ALL KNOWN clutter paths of apps that are installed and that share their path with a top-level folder. Combined with a few other improvements scan speed should stay about the same, but be much more thorough. This overall change was inspired users who mailed me and with which I worked toegether <3 to improve detection for many Tencent apps (which are quite dirty ಠ_ಠ).
- Improved: Filter for ads and hidden caches (e.g. WeChat).
- Improved: Filter for bugreporting related files (e.g. Tencent related apps).
- Improved: Matching in cases where two apps share the same path but only one app creates expendable files in a subdirectory of that path. Previously files could be missed depending on which app was matched first to a folder.
- Improved: Matching performance by switching from `contains` to `startsWith` for pre-filtering results. Most comparison are done using regular expressions, but because those are costly, SD Maid does a quick check before that. Previously this was mostly done using `contains` but for comparisons of small strings this could lead to too many false-positive matches and thus trying the expensive regular expression. I've switched a lot of definitions to `startsWith` which is more restrictive in that regard.

### Scheduler
- Fixed: Scheduler not restoring after updates on Android Oreo+.

## SD Maid [v4.12.3](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/65?closed=1) 02.12.2018
### Core
- Improved: Clutter database.
- Improved: Log output for debugging.
- Improved: Translations.
- Fixed: Potential crash when updating statistics.

- Fixed: Potential crash when loading app data and the IPC buffer runs full (android.os.TransactionTooLargeException).

### Databases
- Fixed: SQlite biniary not working on <= Android 5.1 (#2154).

## SD Maid [v4.12.2](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/64?closed=1) 28.11.2018
### Core
- Improved: Clutter database.
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Updated internal sqlite binary to `3250300` (#2042).
- Improved: Few minor layout tweaks to have nicer paddings/margins-

### Explorer
- Fixed: CorpseFinder icon tinting.
	- Red: Corpse is flagged as 'common', meaning it has such a generic name that SD Maid won't make deletion decisions on it, despite knowing an app that owns it.
	- Orange: Corpse is flagged as 'keeper', meaning there is an app that owns this but marks this item as 'desirable remnant', depending on settings, SD Maid will delete it.

### SystemCleaner
- Fixed: Log filter deleting Telegram X's settings (#2147).

### AppControl
- Improved: List item layout for devices with very large fonts.
- Improved: Layout performance.

### Databases
- Improved: Updated SD Maid's SQL binary. SQL databases were skipped if they contained features from newer version (e.g. Chrome) (#2042).
- Fixed: Details not updating when retrying operations on items (#2151).

## SD Maid [v4.12.1](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/63?closed=1) 27.11.2018
### Core
- Improved: New translations, also fixed a few typos.
- Improved: Clutter database, also added additional dynamic clutter matchers for common directories used by many apps. A dynamic matcher isn't a hardcoded reference but can instead infer ownership without directly knowing an app.
- Improved: Setup time on rooted devices, reduced the number used root shells.

### Explorer
- Fixed: "Share" action not working reliably on Android Nougat and newer.

### AppControl
- Improved: Labels & descriptions.
- Improved: Loading time, by reducing the number of used root shells.

### AppCleaner
- Added: Extra filter for WeChat/Weixin
- Improved: Hidden caches and bugreporting filter, better matching for WeChat/Weixin.

### Core
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Clutter database, fresh new app<->file relations.
- Improved: Pathes in details are no longer in process order, but sorted by path.
- Fixed: Rejecting the mount applet unnecessarily on systemless ROMs which could lead to SD Maid relinquishing root access (#2110).
- Removed: Links to SD Maid's G+ due to Google sunsetting the service (#2061).
- Improved: Internal changes to SD Maid's testing routines.

### Overview
- Improved: Text is now selectable (#2121).

### Statistics
- Changed: Increased default retention to 7 days.

## SD Maid [v4.11.10](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/61?closed=1) 30.10.2018
### Core
- Improved: Translations
- Improved: Ownership detection and updated definitions.
- Fixed: Possible crash when SD Maid is started during an update.

### AppControl
- Fixed: Possible crash when creating Activity shortcuts.

### SystemCleaner
- Improved: Long pathes should no longer be cut off when creating user filters (#2055).
- Improved: Multiline support when editing long pathes in user filters (#2056).

### AppCleaner
- Fixed: Some exclusions were unnecessarily prevented from being applied. On <= Android 6.0 the `freeStorageAndNotify` trick is used to clear private caches, this technique doesn't support exclusions, so SD Maid prevents exclusions that overlap with the default caches from being applied. This resulted in some edge cases where exclusion are not applied even though they are not affected.

## SD Maid [v4.11.9](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/60?closed=1) 22.09.2018
### Core

- Improved: Settings migration related code, better cold start performance (#1908).
- Improved: If the main app is open while the root check times out a little hint toast is shown (#1898).
- Improved: The navigation drawers background color is now the same as each nav item such that if it contains only a few items, that it looks better (#1878).
- Fixed: Crash on initialization (first task/setup) due to undocumented behavior of some ROMs (e.g. Infinix/TECNO) (#1906).
- Fixed: File size in details previews being cut off (#1886).

### AppCleaner
- Improved: Hidden caches filter (ZArchiver) (#1889).
- Changed: Moved UnityCache related matching from the hidden caches filter to the offline caches filter.
- Changed: The offline cache filter is now visible without having experimental features enabled (#1887).

### QuickAccess
- Fixed: Total amount including sizes of tools that are not visible (e.g. duplicates has data but is not shown) (#1908).

## SD Maid [v4.11.4](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/55?closed=1) 20.07.2018
### Core

- Improved: Reduced analytics, data that isn't used doesn't need to be gathered.
- Improved: Update check code, added support for HTTPS (encrypt all the things!)(#1876, #808).
- Changed: I've moved SD Maid related services to new servers at [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/782112f2c46a). Should have no impact on users, but makes the dev happy :).

### Overview
- Fixed: Calculation of free space showing negative values on some devices (#1863).

### AppControl
- Improved: Small improvements to the uninstaller code.
- Fixed: Crash when trying to export an app that can't be exported (#1868).

### AppCleaner
- Improved: Hidden caches filter (#1852).

### StorageAnalyzer
- Fixed: Path copied via breadcrumbs containing extra characters (#1869).

### QuickAccess
- Changed: I've made the duplicates tool opt-in again due to some valid concerns that were raised. New users would delete their duplicates without checking the details and possible delete files that were duplicated on purpose.

## SD Maid [v4.11.3](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/54?closed=1) 10.07.2018 (BETA)
### Core

- Fixed: Possible crash on rotation.

### AppControl
- Improved: Handling of apps uninstalled by 3rd parties.
- Improved: Only show "Show in explorer" for successful APK exports (#1789).
- Improved: Small tweaks to improve performance (e.g. don't try to create a path if it already exists).

- Improved: Sortmode label (#1788).

### Duplicates
- Fixed: Duplicate word in the delete task's result (#1788).

## SD Maid [v4.11.1](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/52?closed=1) 30.06.2018 (BETA)
### Core
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Tweaks to crash related logging.
- Improved: Coldstart performance (new SD Maid instance to first task running) by fixing an inefficiency that caused the root check to run twice if there was no root available.
- Fixed: Crash on app launch when running <Android 5.1. A component that was only meant for newer APIs was falsely initialized (#1774)
- Fixed: Crash when running any tasks with specific progress messages in Thai due to faulty localization (#1777).
- Fixed: Possible crash when entering advanced settings (#1779).
- Fixed: Possible crash when opening the app (#1780).

### Widget
- Fixed: Crash when creating or canceling creation of a new widget (#1778).

## SD Maid [v4.11.0](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/50?closed=1) 29.06.2018 (BETA)
### Core
- Added: An in-app screen to report issues/ideas to GitHub (#1111) that is currently only visible in betas.
- Added: Dynamic clutter matching for another common dev mistake (`/sdcard/data/user/0`) (#1756).
- Added: Support for Instant Apps (#1503). Requires root as instant apps are hidden from other apps by the system.
- Added: Android P permission `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` which is necessary to start a service that runs with just a notification as UI element.
- Improved: Reverted previous workarounds that have been fixed in newer Android P releases.
- Improved: Small changes to used sentences and words within the settings UI elements.
- Improved: Reduced overall UI code related technical debt. Looking at some older code I recognized a few chances to simplify code and reduce side-effects that just weren't obvious to me before 🤷.
- Improved: More addition ands updates to the clutter database.
- Improved: Translations (ty!).
- Improved: Adjusted toolbar titles/subtitles such that the tool-name is always the primary title and the current subsection the subtitle.
- Improved: The navigation drawer will now flash the scrollbar shortly when opening such that new users know the drawer can be vertically scrolled (#1708).
- Improved: On rooted devices SD Maid will now also check `/sbin/` for usable binaries (#1694).
- Improved: App loading performance. All tools now get their app information from a common repository that offers a smart caching mechanism to reduce the amount of overlapping app data we request from the system.
- Improved: General reduction of technical debt. Overhaul of SD Maids dependency injection.
- Changed: SD Maids `armed` status is now visible in the hidden debug menu if experimental features are enable (previously restricted to dev builds). Changing this feature puts MOST (NOT ALL) features into a 'DEMO' mode, e.g. no files are actually deleted which can be quite useful for debugging (#1723).
- Improved: Text readability in various areas (#1663).
- Improved: Check usage of `https` for websites (#1580).
- Improved: Increased crash log size in BETA builds.
- Changed: SD Maid now has a target/compile API level of 28 (Android P), and still a minimum API level of 16 (Android 4.1).
- Fixed: Service notification message not updating correctly after the initial setup task finishes (#1684).
- Fixed: Edge case that could lead to SD Maid requesting just by being opened.

### Explorer
- Improved: Removing bookmarks will now ask for confirmation first (#1385).
- Improved: When opening files an app chooser should now be shown (#1685).
- Fixed: Launcher shortcut option not working on Android Oreo and later (#1743).
- Fixed: Don't allow trying to extract directories (#1761).

### CorpseFinder
- Fixed: False-positives related to 'Instant Apps' (#1724).

### AppControl
- Added: Option to reset settings to default (#1762).
- Added: Instant apps filter option.
- Added: Reverse sort option (#1656).
- Added: New Android P permission `REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES` which is required on to uninstall apps (#1579).
- Improved: Scan speed by delaying some information gathering until app details are viewed (#1753).
- Improved: Messages in confirmation dialoges (#1730).
- Improved: Refactored main and details UI code to new architecture.
- Improved: Sorting can now be changed without triggering a task (#1253).
- Improved: Migrated settings to it's own module (backup is coming... just gotta migrate all tools 😩).
- Fixed: Launcher shortcut option not working on Android Oreo and later (#1743).
- Fixed: Scan being triggered just by opening the UI.
- Removed: `NO_APK` filter option due to being virtually never used with the Android versions that SD Maid is comaptible (this was more of a pre holo thing...).

### SystemCleaner
- Improved: User filter manager now has a 'select all' option (#1414).
- Improved: User filters are now sorted by their label to give a consistent order between devices (#1414).
- Improved: User filter help texts (#1415).

### AppCleaner
- Added: Removable default exclusion for `WINE` (#1571).
- Added: A new "Offline Caches" filter (opt-in). Currently only matches very apps. If you know apps that could be added create a ticket on GitHub please!
- Improved: Hidden caches filter. Expanded the list of potential names folders and added a specific entries for known apps (#1650).
- Improved: Better icon for the filter options (in the future we could consolidate the options & filters and then make a shortcut to that).
- Improved: Added exclusion routines VERY early on such that apps that cause the search to slow down to a crawl can be effectively excluded (#1571).

### Duplicates
- Improved: Various UI elements, e.g. details related to showing the task results.
- Improved: Finished refactoring the details view to the new UI architecture (the main view was already refactored in 4.10.0).

### StorageAnalyzer
- Improved: UI code. Refactored existing UI code to new architecture (just like the other tools).
- Fixed: Scroll position not being remembered (new UI code yay 🙌) (#1300).

### Databases
- Added: Removable default exclusion for `WINE` (#1571).
- Added: Sortmodes (#1136).
- Added: Option to reset settings to defaults.
- Added: 'Show in Explorer' option.
- Added: More file and directory types that will be considered when trying to find valid databases that SD Maid can process.
- Improved: Progress feedback during search.
- Improved: Various small UI tweaks (icon order, padding and margins).- Improved: Added exclusion routines VERY early on such that apps that cause the search to slow down to a crawl can be effectively excluded (#1571).
- Improved: Task result messages, try to show how much space was gained.
- Improved: The resulting list of databases can now also be searched by database name.
- Improved: Refactored the UI code to use the new architecture (https://github.com/d4rken/mvp-bakery).
- Improved: When working on databases that have multiple owners, SD Maid should now correctly suspend and resume ALL known owners.
- Improved: Database settings have been moved into their own module which allows for a reset feature (and future backup functionality).
- Changed: System apps are no longer included by default, and require opt-in via settings. Potential issue: If the `Skip running apps` option is not checked on a rooted device, it could come to a situation where SD Maid pauses a system process to work on it's database which can make the system unstable until reboot. While this is very rare to occur, SD Maids default settings should prioritize safety. Power users can just enable it via settings (#1562).
- Fixed: When checking which app owns a database we shouldn't exclude owners that are marked as `COMMON` (which are apps that own folders that have such common names that we can't reasonably use the information for deletion, database operations are different though, so we shouldn't ignore them). 
- Fixed: An edge cases where SD Maid end up working on a database even if the app, that we think owns the database, is not installed. The issue here is that it's likely that the database is owned by another (unknown) app and we can't skip or pause it then.
- Fixed: Searching the UI not always returning the expected entries.

### Scheduler

### CorpseFinder
- Improved: UninstallWatcher now uses the same scan scope as the normal scan from SD Maids UI. It was previously limited to public storage, and private app data storage.

- Improved: Clutter database ([#481](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/481), [#480](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/480), [#479](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/479)).
- Improved: If a tool can't find any storage (why?), that tool will now display an error instead of crashing SD Maid.
- Improved: Display of error messages in tools.
- Fixed: Crash on devices where SD Maid used rootfs injection to get a working binary. Despite having root, SD Maid didn't use when looking up mounts, causing that to fail and SD Maid ending up with no detected storages ([#475](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/475) Ty Sandris).
- Fixed: Crash if the shell process would die prematurely. Tasks scheduled for execution would get a NULL result instead of an result with state "error".

### AppControl
- Fixed: Crash if estates were determined based on a stale list of installed apps.

### SystemCleaner
- Added: Filter for `/data/logger` (LG devices) ([#464](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/464)).
- Improved: Matching of already existing filters, better deal with file-seperators.

### Storage Analyzer
- Fixed: Crash when operations were too quick (divide by 0) ([#477](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/477)).
- Fixed: Crash wen pressing the backbutton without loaded data ([#476](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/476)).

## SD Maid [v4.3.0](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/1?closed=1) - 02.09.2016 (BETA)
### Core
- Added: Adaptive support for different (core-utils providing) binaries, currently "toybox" and "busybox".
- Added: Added support for location "/oem" ([#441](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/441) Ty randomname1234).
- Added: Option to toggle animations (currently only coffee drinking).
- Added: If SD Maid is running in the background but requires setup via user action, operations are canceled and a notification is displayed ([#435](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/435) Ty sjoshua270).
- Added: SD Maids file forensics can now get clutter markers from dynamic sources. This means that in addition to static sources (i.e. a database with entries), there are now dynamic sources that can generate clutter markers without explicitly knowing an app.
- Added: Dynamic clutter sources for `.UTSystemConfig` and `.EveryplayCache`.
- Improved: Accuracy of size calculation when deleting files of which some failed to be deleted (or don't exist anymore).
- Improved: Clutter database (dozen of new entries).
- Improved: Clutter database format to better cover multiple apps with the same clutter.
- Improved: Updated all of SD Maids dependencies and libraries.
- Improved: Instead of tapping out with a "busybox error", SD Maid will now relinquish root access if the current toybox/busybox setup is not root compatible ([#442](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/442)).
- Improved: Both busybox and toybox can be used by SD Maid and both types of binaries will be tried as fallback solution ([#452](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/452)).
- Improved: Reduced SD Maids resource (RAM/CPU) consumption by reducing the amount of shells that are kept open. Reading files now shares a shell with all other operations (delete, move, copy etc).
- Improved: Operation results (ok, skipped, failed) now only show values that are non zero.
- Improved: Speed of file object creation, some calls be done in a more effective order and a few memory optimizations weren't effective.
- Improved: File forensics performance, less information is (i.e. App name) is requested during research and deferred to be gathered when it is actually needed.
- Improved: Reduced memory use by reducing the footprint of the clutter matching (simpler objects).
- Improved: Ownership detection. In some cases SD Maid will now match "fixed paths" -> "variable packagenames", previousy we could only match "fixed package names" -> "variable pathes". Example: Match "/sdcard/.strawberry/eu.thedarken.sdm" without specifically having a database entry for "eu.thedarken.sdm").
- Improved: Busybox error screen shows more device infos and a better explanation.
- Improved: Logging. Reduced logging in production builds and adjusted logging priorities to be more useful (verbose vs debug).
- Fixed: Task results not showing correct amount of failed deletions.
- Fixed: "Double tap to exit" toast not being correctly themed ([#438](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/438) Ty TWiStErRob).
- Fixed: Shell data not being disregarded directly if data is streamed instead of buffered. This should reduce peak memory consumption during scan for SystemCleaner, Duplicates, Biggest and Databases.
- Fixed: Commands failing that use remounting on Android 6.0+. Multiple mount commands were used to guarantee reliable execution on different devices, but on some the toybox binary segfault. This would cause any command using remounting to end up with a segfault (139) errorcode. SD Maid now checks if the toybox binary segfaults during setup.
- Fixed: A racecondition where the FAB become visible when SD Maid started executing a task triggered from list multiselection.
- Fixed: Shell operation (move/create) failing if the the target path was a symlink pointing to a read-only partition with a different path (e.g. /vendor -> /system/vendor).
- Fixed: Random crashes related to inflating the menu in each tools toolbar, possibly related to devices with hardware menu-buttons.
- Fixed: Crash related to a race-condition between UI input (e.g. clicks) and UI state.
- Fixed: Crash if SD Maid could not find any locations of type `SDCARD` but tried use the data to build sub-locations such as `PUBLIC_DATA`.
- Changed: Instead of file length, "size on filesystem" is now used to calculate the amount of space freed by a deletion. You will notice that with the exception of sparse-files, deletion will show slightly (blocksize) increased amounts of freed space, especially when deleting lots of small files.
- Changed: SD Maid now ships with toybox instead of busybox (leaner and fixes [#451](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/451)).
- Changed: Log files are now stored in SD Maids cache instead of files folder (i.e. `/sdcard/Android/data/eu.thedarken.sdm/cache/logfiles`).
- Changed: If root access is available, SD Maid will skip asking for storage access via the storage-access-framework (SAF).

### QuickAccess
- Fixed: Database tool still requiring confirmation despite single-pass option activated.

### Overview
- Added: If SD Maid relinquihes root access to avoid a busybox/toybox error the root state will display this ([#442](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/442)).
- Changed: Refresh no longer reloads the storage manager, it is now only refreshed once per session.

### Explorer
- Added: Option to place a shortcut on your home screen which open the explorer and refreshes it ([#187](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/187)).
- Added: Octal permission display when changing permissions.
- Added: Reporting option via context menu if you have experimental mode enabled.
- Added: Support for extracting ZIP (zip/apk etc, anything zip based) files ([#198](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/198)).
- Added: Details dialog, currently a bit rough, will be expanded later on.
- Added: Files now show both blocksize (size file actually occupies) and file length (size file says it is), if this value differs. The format is `size on storage (file length)`.
- Fixed: Pathbar at the top not updating correctly when switching to the Explorer from a different tool, directly loading that path ([#439](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/439)).
- Fixed: Creating dirs/files not updating directory content correctly without extra refresh.
- Fixed: Directory content not updating correctly after deletion.
- Fixed: Paste action causing change to parent directory.
- Fixed: Trying to remount a source as `rw` if we are only copying files.
- Fixed: When trying to create a file the operation could return an error even if it was successful.
- Changed: Don't popup a snackbar for every path change.

### Searcher
- Added: Options find files based on minimum and maximum modification date. Using these options automatically causes results to be sorted by date.

### AppControl
- Added: Right-side drawer with additional information and filtering options ([#406](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/406)).
- Improved: Tags for filtering (e.g. frozen apps) are no longer a search string and can be used in addition to manual search input (i.e. search in all frozen apps).
- Improved: SD Maid will check more locations now to find all items that belong to an app, this was previously limited to specific locations such as data/dalvik etc. but now covers all locations SD Maid knows.
- Improved: Files and sizes belonging to each app (estate) can now be determined on-demand.
- Improved: Speed when determining files owned by an app (estate).
- Changed: By default app files and sizes are not researched during list generation, except if the sort-mode is SIZE or the option to do the research in advance is turned on in the settings.
- Fixed: Corruption of exported APKs ([#451](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/451)).

### CorpseFinder
- Improved: SDcard filter scan speed. Changes to clutter information allow us to better determine when we have to search deeper and when reading the top level item is sufficient.
- Improved: Reporting tool is now more comfortable and allows adding more information.
- Changed: Reports are now posted via GitHub, which requires a free GitHub account. People that want to contribute can now do so in higher quality and get recognition for their contributions. People who kept spamming me via the old report tool with weird stories can now try again and then be banned from SD Maids GitHub repository.

### SystemCleaner
- Added: Tracking to determine how often UserFilter are actually used.
- Added: `.chartboost` and `adhub` to advertisement filter.
- Added: Help link to SD Maids wiki ([#298](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/298) Ty Trasd).
- Improved: Some people create placeholders for `__chartboost` and `.chartboost` to block them from being created, these will no longer be removed.
- Fixed: UserFilter creation was possible without the pro version.
- Fixed: Size calculation for AdvertisementFilter items, should now also show children of matched directories ([#471](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/471) Ty Solomon1732).

### Biggest
- Added: File previews if you have SD Maid Pro.
- Added: Support for locations requiring root access ([#129](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/129)).
- Added: "Device view" ([#467](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/467)). The tool starts out with a "device view" showing all available storages the tool can show. Changing any settings is no longer necessary.
- Improved: Refresh behavior. Previously a refresh caused the whole cached file-tree to be reloaded. Now we can just refresh subnodes of the cached file-tree.
- Changed: Made list items more compact ([#346](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/346)).
- Changed: The tool has been renamed to "Storage analyzer".
- Removed: Settings page (no longer necessary).

## SD Maid [4.2.9] - 29.06.2016
### Core
- Added: Support for plurals (day/days, item/items) where applicable.
- Improved: Translations (specifically plurals).
- Fixed: Possibly racecondition crash on devices with physical menu buttons when they are rapidly pressed during UI changes ([#341](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/341)).

- Improved: Navigation should be more consistent, instead of buttons/crumbs not reacting, SD Maid will now enter any folder and display any errors it may encounter.
- Fixed: Crash when pressung the backbutton on a cold start.
- Fixed: Crash due to trying to load "//" after navigating to the root, then reentering the Explorer again.

### QuickAccess
- Added: Summary of estimated space affected by actions to be executed (because we can't know how much it is for VACUUM per databases, it currently just adds 4KB per database) ([#407](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/407)).

## SD Maid [4.2.8] - 25.06.2016
### Core
- Improved: Updated translations.
- Fixed: Settings pages not opening ([#424](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/424) Ty Trasd).

## SD Maid [4.2.7] - 25.06.2016
### Core
- Updated: Clutter database.
- Improved: Resiliance against weird storage setups. SD Maid will try continue even if the system API crashes while trying to determine external storages.
- Changed: The working notification is now no longer cosmetic and will elevate the service to foreground priority within the systems task killer, when the workers are done and the result is displayed, the service releases foreground mode and displays a normal notification.
- Changed: Settings layout and behavior. Removed lots of legacy code and wrote a cleaner solution that is not as fragile to support library updates.
- Fixed: Preferences not being themed correctly ([#421](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/421) Ty dukelc).

### Explorer
- Fixed: Not navigating correctly between symlinked directories ([#416](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/416) Ty Morpheus)

### AppControl
- Fixed: Uninstalls, freezing and disabling of broadcast receivers failing since v4.2.6 due to component names not being correctly wrapped when being passed to the packagemanager ([#422](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/422) Ty Roman).

### SystemCleaner
- Changed: Filter that only work on rooted devices will now be hidden if SD Maid doesn't have root (it's cleaner and less confusing).
- Fixed: Longer filter load time due to root filter being loaded on unrooted devices.

### Scheduler
- Improved: Reliability when running in background. The working notification is now used to start the service in foreground mode, which should reduce issues with SD Maid being prematurely killed to free memory ([#420](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/420)).

### Widget
- Fixed: Color issues on Android N.

## SD Maid [4.2.6] - 19.06.2016
### Core
- Added: Support for "/vendor" as location within tools (affects AppControl).
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Logging when troubleshooting issues
- Improved: Simplified actions necessary to help me debug issues.
- Improved: Speed of executing shell commands. Any tool (basically all tools) using shell commands should be slightly faster now.
- Improved: Now building against Android N (API24).
- Improved: Several layout files have been fixed for future (correct) RTL support.
- Changed: Debugging options have been moved into a hidden page which can be reached through long presing the settings entry. This makes it easier to record debug logs if SD Maid malfunctions during setup (as entering settings already triggers a basic setup).
- Fixed: Issues handling files with unicode characters in their name ([#408](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/408)).
- Fixed: SD Maid accepting system busyboxes that don't work correctly (seg fault), but also return correct data ([#397](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/397)).
- Fixed: Overlapping switch buttons overlaying other UI elements on <5.0 ([#398](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/398)).

### Explorer
- Fixed: Fixed being able to select directories for the share action leading to errors ([#383](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/383)).

### AppControl

- Fixed: List elements making a clicking sound despite not being clickable.
- Fixed: System app uninstall failing for files sourcing their apk from /vendor ([#410](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/410) Ty Morpheus).

### AppCleaner
- Fixed: Private app directories not being completely searched if directory permission allow reading (or more) without root ([#413](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/413) Ty rsngfrce & JERW86).

### Widget
- Improved: Handling of UI updates if multiple widgets are used.
- Fixed: All actions triggering if widget is more than one action is defined.

### Scheduler
- Improved: TimePicker will use 12/24 mode depending on system settings ([#415](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/415)).

## SD Maid [4.2.5] - 10.06.2016
### Core
- Improved: Updated clutter database.
- Improved: Reduced log spam on <4.3 devices due to missing functionality.
- Improved: Resilience against weird storage setups, in this case the internal storage being available multiple times (spotted on X800+, Micromax q346).
- Fixed: Crash when a system apk exists but can't be read.
- Fixed: More cases of UI raceconditions that could lead to crashes.

### AppCleaner
- Improved: Advertisement filter, added "Vungle" (Ty Brandon).

### Databases
- Changed: Collation sequence errors will now be shown as "skipped" as this is a permanent condition and distracts from actual errors.

### Scheduler
- Fixed: Cutoff layout of schedule picker on small screens (it now scrolls).

## SD Maid [4.2.4] - 04.06.2016
### Core
- Improved: Ownership detection for `/system/app` and `/system/priv-app` files that are superseeded by an updated app in userspace (prepares for future AppControl operations and Explorer enhancements).
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Improved exit behavior. Less UI lag when exiting SD Maid and operations have to be cancelled.
- Fixed: Navigation entry width glitching when doing a cold start of the app on tool pages where the navigation menu is opened on launch.
- Fixed: Glitchy showing and hiding of tabhostbar in details activies if there is only one item.
- Fixed: A few UI crashes in details pages when operations finished just when you were closing or opening the UI.
- Fixed: Subtitle shortly showing as "CorpseFinder" when opening details activies.
- Fixed: False positive ownership detection, if app names overlap, in `/system/priv-app`, `/system/app` and `/system`.

### AppControl
- Fixed: Failing system app uninstalls if it's apk removal was blocked through a false positive ownership match ([#391](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/391) Ty Alexey).

### AppCleaner
- Added: Optional filter for files received through WhatsApp.
- Fixed: Exclusions not working completely on unrooted devices despite deactivatin the "freeStorageAndNotify" option ([#401](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/401) Ty Kisl0iD).

### Biggest
- Changed: Searchpath has been reset to prepare for future support of multiple locations.

### Databases
- Fixed: Settings displaying (not using) wrong default search pathes under specific conditions.

## SD Maid [4.2.3] - 28.05.2016
### Core
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Added fallback options if for some reason the default private cache or files directory doesn't exist (weird crash reports from weird devices).

### CorpseFinder
- Fixed: A few cases of false positive results within filters for "/data/app", "/data/app-private", "/data/app-asec" and "/data/app-lib", if the install number appendix is bigger than a single digit ([#394](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/394) Ty ew@XDA).

### AppCleaner
- Fixed: Possible crash when opening/closing the UI right after a deletion.

### Scheduler
- Fixed: Scheduler ward being disabled when it shouldn't be. The scheduler ward cares for the scheduler alarm and reinstates it if necessary. For battery improvements this component is enabled/disabled if not necessary, but its state was falsely tied to the existence of the alarm instead of the setting that tells us whether it should be turned on. 

## SD Maid [4.2.2] - 24.05.2016
### Core
- Added: Launch screen.
- Added: A hidden debug menu :).
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Clutter database.
- Improved: Improved overall scan speed by reducing time it takes to match clutter markers (skip internal test data, require simple match before regex match).
- Removed: No longer needed logging statements.
- Fixed: A couple of rare UI related racecondition crashes (i.e. opening closing the ui with tasks finishing simultaneously). 

### AppControl
- Fixed: Crash when exiting app details after uninstalling app on Android <4.1.2.

### CorpseFinder
- Improved: Scan speed of SDCARD filter.

### AppCleaner

- Fixed: Deleted item reappearing if a directory is reentered.

### Scheduler
- Added: Automatic scheduler check when launching SD Maid.
- Improved: Accuracy of seconds countdown.
- Improved: Reduced resource use, we no longer need to check the countdown daily.
- Changed: Rewrote implementation and use of the AlarmManager service in an attempt to fix the unreliability I could not reproduce.

### Statistics
- Improved: Space usage, better truncating of data, preemptively throw away old data if new data will exceed the truncate threshold.
- Improved: Handling of error situations such as inaccessible databases or full disks (should crash less often).

## SD Maid [4.2.1] - 12.05.2016
### Core
- Updated: Translations.
- Improved: Detection of dalvik-cache locations, previously the SDK level was used, now we check for actual existence.
- Improved: Storage detection for devices that return non-absolute pathes from API calls for external storage (likely due to user modifications, e.g. XInternalSD). Pathes are now checked for absoluteness and SD Maid should now either not crash at all or continue gracefully.
- Fixed: Crash when resuming SD Maid after being purged from memory and the last page open was a details page.).
- Fixed: Navigation entries showing extra highlights when being clicked.

### Explorer
- Fixed: Crash if the current path the explorer tried to open is invalid (e.g. not absolute).

### CorpseFinder
- Fixed: Crash within the DalvikCache filter if a device has files both in `/cache/dalvik-cache` and `/data/dalvik-cache`.

### SystemCleaner
- Improved: Scan performance by reducing overhead of matching against file pathes.
- Fixed: Filter-modules not loading and filter configuration being empty ([#387](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/387) Ty igoivo).
- Fixed: Crash when creating a UserFilter and entering a minimum or maximum size > Long.MAX_VALUE.

### AppCleaner
- Fixed: Crash if caches were found via clutter database entries and there was more than one entry matching the same file/directory ([#388](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/388)).
- Fixed: Non-Root routines being used even if root is not available.

## SD Maid [4.2.0] - 11.05.2016
### Core
- Added: User interface for adding and testing regular expression based exclusions.
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Workaround for KingoRoot should now be automatically applied (setting has been removed).
- Improved: Details entries should no longer cutoff pathes, independent of their length.
- Improved: Setup layouts are now scrollable to allow viewing full content on small devices with large fonts ([#368](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/368)).
- Improved: Reduced peak memory consumption by making a few core objects easier to be garbage collected.
- Improved: Setup help menu is now available on all setup steps and directly open the setup help page now.
- Improved: Slightly changed timing when the UI is initialised to reduce/fix a few random crashes.

- Improved: Task description in confirmations and dialogs.
- Fixed: During secondary storage setup, storage entry not turning green despite success, on low memory devices.
- Fixed: Secondary storage detection on MediaTek devices. Added a workaround that detects this the swapped storage situation and fakes the primary UUID ([#312](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/312) Ty bgiesing).
- Removed: Update databases option in advanced settings. Will be replaced with a better mechanism in a future update.

### Overview
- Added: Info how much space is left until the storage is considered full.
- Changed: The icon color of storage entries will now change according to system behavior. Red meaning the system considers the storage full, orange meaning the system considers the storage low on space and restrictions apply (e.g. not being able to install new apps).

### Explorer
- Added: Option to enable/disable research of items that match an AppCleaner filter.
- Added: Option to enable/disable research of items that match a SystemCleaner filter.
- Added: Icon that shows whether an item matches a SystemCleaner filter.
- Improved: Adjusted entries such that entry layouts expand for very long filenames.
- Fixed: "Save directory structure" and "Force MediaScan" only being visible if >1 items are selected.

### Searcher
- Added: Delete action for selected items.
- Added: Option to turn off automatic wildscards to allow searching for exact matches.

### AppControl
- Added: List of app permissions to app details.
- Added: Paths in app details are now clickable. Clicking a path opens it in the Explorer.
- Fixed: Crash when checking the state of a component that is for some reason UNKNOWN, we will return it as disabled now.
- Changed: Removed circle cropping from app icons.

### CorpseFinder

- Improved: Detection of hidden caches nested in /files/.
- Improved: Updated cache database (Samsung gallery temp files).
- Improved: Made progress feedback a little more detailed.
- Improved: Speed of the initial searchpath building step. It should now be faster by a factor of ~10x (caching some resources that were previous looked up on demand).
- Improved: Speed of the file search and filtering step. Fixing a few badly written routines (nobody is perfect) made the whole thing ~2x faster on my test device.
- Improved: Peak memory consumption during scan. A few objects can be released earlier from memory now which should help against out of memory crashes on low end devices.
- Fixed: Not cleaning private caches on unrooted device if the action was triggered through the FAB instead of the toolbar (Ty Steffen).

### Duplicates
- Fixed: Crash when autoselecting from a filtered list ([#367](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/issues/367)).
- Fixed: Crash when a stale item was attempted to be selected.

### Databases
