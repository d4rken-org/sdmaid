## SD Maid [v5.3.21](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/166?closed=1) 15.05.2022
### Core

## SD Maid [v5.3.20](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/165?closed=1) 01.05.2022
### Core
- Improved: Translations.
- Improved: Clutter database.

### AppCleaner
- Improved: Previously SD Maid relied on a lot of hardcoded values to determine what SD Maid needs to click when using the AppCleaner accessibility service option. Now SD Maid will attempt to read the correct labels from the system settings APK directly and only use the previous way as fallback. This allows SD Maid to automatically support all languages for a ROM if support is added. Finding the right strings is based on the string IDs. These may differ between ROMs. I could only confirm AOSP/Pixel and Samsung ROMs. If v5.3.20 loops on your ROM, but v5.3.19 didn't: Make an issue ticket and upload your ROMs system settings APK, so I can find the right string IDs, or you do that and just tell me the IDs ;).

## SD Maid [v5.3.19](https://github.com/d4rken/sdmaid-public/milestone/164?closed=1) 21.04.2022

### AppCleaner
- Improved: Bugreporting filter.
- Improved: Hidden chaches filter on MIUI ROMs.

If SD Maid reads the page too quickly, the items we are looking for at not found on screen. So now if SD Maid sees an ellispsis characters and the initial check failed, a short delay is added before the next try (#5401).
- Improved: ACS support for Ukranian.
