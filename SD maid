 SD Maid
Crowdin

SD Maid is an Android app that helps you manage files and apps.

SD Maid has a successor called SD Maid 2/SE.

SD Maid 1/Legacy will keep working as it is, but won't get new features or improvements. Updates will be limited to security fixes. I'm reviewing SD Maid 1 issue tickets and migrating them where applicable. SD Maid 2/SE's issue tracker can be found here.
