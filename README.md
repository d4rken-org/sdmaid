SD Maid is an Android app that helps you manage files and apps.

> **SD Maid has a successor called [SD Maid 2/SE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.darken.sdmse).**
> 
> SD Maid 1/Legacy will keep working as it is, but won't get new features or improvements.
> Updates will be limited to security fixes.
> I'm reviewing SD Maid 1 issue tickets and migrating them where applicable. [SD Maid 2/SE's issue tracker](https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se/issues) can be found here.
